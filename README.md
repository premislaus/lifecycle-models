# Lifecycle Models
Software Development Lifecycle Models is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

## Classics
In the classical life cycle model (also known as the waterfall model), the development of software proceeds linearly and sequentially from requirement analysis to design, coding, testing, integration, implementation, and maintenance. Thus, this model is also known as the linear sequential model.

| Advantages

| This model is simple and easy to understand and use.                                                                       |
| It is easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model – each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.             In this model phases are processed and completed one at a time. Phases do not overlap.                                     | 
| Waterfall model works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.                               |


| Disadvantages                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage.                                                                                         |
| No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.                                                            | High amounts of risk and uncertainty.
| Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
| Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
| Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing.               |

######
When to use the waterfall model:

1.  This model is used only when the requirements are very well known, clear and fixed.
1.  Product definition is stable.
1.  Technology is understood.
1.  There are no ambiguous requirements
1.  Ample resources with required expertise are available freely
1.  The project is short.

## Incremental

## Evolutionary
This approach is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to your appraisal. Each program version inherits the best features from earlier versions. Each version is refined based upon feedback from yourself to produce a system which satisfies your needs. At this point the system may be delivered or it may be re-implemented using a more structured approach to enhance robustness and maintainability. Specification, development and validation activities are concurrent with strong feedback between each.

| Advantages                                                                                                                  
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| During life cycle the software is produced early which facilitates customer evaluation or feedback.                        |
| Risk analysis is better. It supports changing requirements. Initial Operating time is less. Better suited for large as well   as mission critical projects.                                                                                              |


| Disadvantages                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not suitable for smaller projects.                                                                                         |
| Management complexity is more. End of project may not be known which is a risk. Can be costly to use. Highly skilled           resources are required for the risk analysis.                                                                              |
                                                                               


## Spiral

#### History
This model was first described by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper "A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement". In 1988 Boehm published a similar paper to a wider audience. These papers introduce a diagram that has been reproduced in many subsequent publications discussing the spiral model.

| Advantages                                                                                                                  
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced.                                                         |
| Good for large and mission-critical projects.                                                                              |
| Strong approval and documentation control.                                                                                 |
| Additional Functionality can be added at a later date                                                                      | 
| Software is produced early in the software life cycle.                                                                     |
| Project estimates in terms of schedule, cost etc become more and more realistic as the project moves forward and loops in   spiral get completed.                                                                                                        |
| It is suitable for high risk projects, where business needs may be unstable.                                               |
| A highly customized product can be developed using this.                                                                   |



| Disadvantages                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can be a costly model to use.                                                                                              |
| Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.                                                                          |
| Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase.                                                          |
| Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.                                                                                    |
| It is not suitable for low risk projects.                                                                                  |
| May be hard to define objective, verifiable milestones.                                                                    |
| Spiral may continue indefinitely.                                                                                          |
