# Lifecycle Models
Software Development Lifecycle Models is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

## Classics
In the classical life cycle model (also known as the waterfall model), the development of software proceeds linearly and sequentially from requirement analysis to design, coding, testing, integration, implementation, and maintenance. Thus, this model is also known as the linear sequential model.

## Incremental

## Evolutionary
This approach is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to your appraisal. Each program version inherits the best features from earlier versions. Each version is refined based upon feedback from yourself to produce a system which satisfies your needs. At this point the system may be delivered or it may be re-implemented using a more structured approach to enhance robustness and maintainability. Specification, development and validation activities are concurrent with strong feedback between each.

| Advantages                                                                                                                  
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| During life cycle the software is produced early which facilitates customer evaluation or feedback.                        |
| Risk analysis is better. It supports changing requirements. Initial Operating time is less. Better suited for large as well   as mission critical projects.                                                                                              |


| Disadvantages                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not suitable for smaller projects.                                                                                         |
| Management complexity is more. End of project may not be known which is a risk. Can be costly to use. Highly skilled           resources are required for the risk analysis.                                                                              |
                                                                               


## Spiral
![Alt text](/Spiral/spiral.png)

#### History
This model was first described by Barry Boehm in his 1986 paper "A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement". In 1988 Boehm published a similar paper to a wider audience. These papers introduce a diagram that has been reproduced in many subsequent publications discussing the spiral model.

| Advantages                                                                                                                  
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced.                                                         |
| Good for large and mission-critical projects.                                                                              |
| Strong approval and documentation control.                                                                                 |
| Additional Functionality can be added at a later date                                                                      | 
| Software is produced early in the software life cycle.                                                                     |
| Project estimates in terms of schedule, cost etc become more and more realistic as the project moves forward and loops in   spiral get completed.                                                                                                        |
| It is suitable for high risk projects, where business needs may be unstable.                                               |
| A highly customized product can be developed using this.                                                                   |



| Disadvantages                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can be a costly model to use.                                                                                              |
| Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.                                                                          |
| Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase.                                                          |
| Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.                                                                                    |
| It is not suitable for low risk projects.                                                                                  |
| May be hard to define objective, verifiable milestones.                                                                    |
| Spiral may continue indefinitely.                                                                                          |
