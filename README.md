# Lifecycle Models
Software Development Lifecycle Models is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

## Classics
In the classical life cycle model (also known as the waterfall model), the development of software proceeds linearly and sequentially from requirement analysis to design, coding, testing, integration, implementation, and maintenance. Thus, this model is also known as the linear sequential model.
